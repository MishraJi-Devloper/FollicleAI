FollicleAI is built to give you **awareness-based** insights about your hair and scalp. It does *not* provide medical diagnosis, and it never replaces professional care.

## What we analyze
- **Hair density** based on visible scalp coverage
- **Thinning level** using rule-based patterns
- **Scalp health score** for overall visual condition
- **Hair type** (oily, dry, or normal)

## Why it matters
Understanding your baseline helps you ask better questions and track change over time. If you’re concerned, consult a qualified healthcare professional.

## Your privacy comes first
We do not store your images permanently. Uploads are deleted within 24 hours and are not used for facial recognition.
