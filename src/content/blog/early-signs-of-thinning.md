Noticing changes in hair density can be concerning. Here are common visual patterns that people report:

## 1. Increased scalp visibility
If more scalp shows through in normal lighting, it may indicate changes in density.

## 2. Wider part line
A part that appears wider than usual can be a subtle sign of thinning.

## 3. Reduced volume
Hair that feels less full or sits flatter may reflect density changes.

## 4. Temporal recession
Shifts around the temples can be an early pattern change for some individuals.

### What next?
- Track changes every 3–6 months with consistent lighting.
- Review stress, nutrition, and sleep habits.
- Consult a healthcare professional for medical guidance.
